\section*{Elastic parallel computing with R, Redis and the foreach package on Amazon EC2}

The doRedis package makes it easy to scale out parallel R compute jobs using
Amazon's elastic compute cloud. The R package includes example scripts for
setting up a doRedis service that can be used with EC2.

\section*{Configure an Amazon Instance}

Begin with a Linux-based Amazon instance. This example should work on
RHEL/CentOS or Ubuntu-based AMIs. The step-by-step command-line process
outlined below assumes Ubuntu.

\subsection*{Install R and Redis and prerequisites}

The bash shell is required by the doRedis service.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,caption=Installing prerequisites,language=]
sudo apt-get build-dep r-base libxml2-dev libssl-dev \
     libcurl4-openssl-dev unzip  redis-server
wget https://www.cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.2.3.tar.gz
# (or most current version of R)
tar xf R-3.2.3.tar.gz
cd R-3.2.3
./configure --enable-R-shlib --enable-memory-profiling
make -j 2     # use an appropriate number of CPUs here
sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection*{Configure Redis to listen on all interfaces}

It is *important* to combine this step with EC2 security firewall rules. You
need access on the Redis port 6379 between nodes in your compute cluster, *but
not to nodes on the internet*.  This is important. Fortunately, it's easy to
achieve in two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Selecting a VPC network when you instantiate nodes; the default
   one (something like vpc-xxxxxxxx 172.31.0.0/16) should work.
\item Edit your security group to add the following inbound rule,
   Protocol: TCP, Port Range: 6379, Source: Custom IP 172.31.0.0/16
\end{enumerate}

Those steps can be performed with the Amazon EC2 GUI console, or from the EC2
CLI or API. Again, it's very important to carefully prevent outsiders from
accessing your Redis port. It must only be available within a VPC network used
by your compute nodes.

The following command will configure your Redis server to listen on all interfaces:
\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=]
sudo sed -i.bak  "s/^bind 127.0.0.1/bind 0.0.0.0/"  /etc/redis/redis.conf && sudo /etc/init.d/redis-server restart
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Install R packages}

Finally, we need to install the foreach, redux, and doRedis packages, plus whatever other
R packages you might want to use. The following script installs redux and doRedis from their
source repository on GitHub using the devtools package.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=]
sudo R --slave -e "install.packages(c('devtools', 'foreach', 'redux'), /
                   repos='https://cran.r-project.org')"
sudo R --slave -e "devtools::install_github('bwlewis/doRedis')"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Install the doRedis service}

The doRedis package includes an example script for setting up R workers as a service.
The script works on generic Linux systems and also has special options to facilitate
running on EC2. Setting up the service for EC2 is easy:

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=]
script=$(R --slave -e "cat(system.file(
         'scripts/redis-worker-installer.sh', package='doRedis'))")
sudo $script EC2
\end{lstlisting}


\section*{Make an AMI from your instance}

Once you've got your instance and its R environment and packages configured to
your liking, make an AMI from it. This can be done from the EC2 control panel
web GUI by shutting down (stopping) your instance and selecting "Image...Create
image" from the instance menu.

Plan on including all the R packages you normally need in your AMI. If you run
the doRedis service as the ``nobody'' user (the default), that user will not be
able to easily install new packages other than in a temporary directory.

\subsection*{Re-start your instance and log back in}

After creating an AMI, you're ready to play with doRedis on EC2. Start up your
master instance and log back in, and note its IP address.

EC2 R/Redis/foreach workers are configured using the Amazon EC2 "user data"
service. We simply need to supply a valid doRedis configuration file as user
data. An example minimum configuration file is, replacing ``172.31.20.55'' with
the IP address of your master node:
\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=]
n: 2
host: 172.31.20.55
\end{lstlisting}

This configures 2 R workers to run per Amazon instance, communicating with the Redis
host at 172.31.20.55, (using a default job queue named ``RJOBS'' in Redis).
You can supply that to newly launched nodes by pasting that in to the user data box
in the EC2 control panel web GUI.

New workers can be added at any time to your R/Redis/foreach cluster at any time by
simply turning them on and passing the configuration user data at startup.
