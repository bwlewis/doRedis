\description{
Removing a doRedis queue cleans up associated keys in the Redis
database and signals to workers listening on the queue to terminate.
Workers terminate after their timeout period after their work
queue is deleted.
}
\note{
Workers listening for work on more than one queue will only
terminate after all their queues have been deleted.
